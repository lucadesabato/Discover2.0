1. Summary
   Duk is a fast, accurate,and efficent DNA sequence matching tool using Kmer hashhing method.

2. Requirement
   Duk should run in any 64 bit Linux/Unix machine with g++.

3. Compile Instruction
   Just type  make to compile the tool.
   >make
4. Manual

  duk [options]  ref.fa query

  Options:
     -o, -output  <file>       print log information to file, default is stdout.
     -n, -nomatch <file>       output the not matched reads to file,
                               the opton value - stands for standard output
     -m, -match <file>      output matched reads to file.
     -k, -kmer                 the k mer size,  default is 16.
     -s, -step                 the step size, default is 4.
     -c, -cutoff               the cut off threshold for matched reads, default is 1.
     -h, -help                 print out the help information


    Identify the reads in query file whether they match to ref.fa reads.
    The ref.fa must be in fasta format and the query can be in fastq or fasta format.
    If there is no query file, the tool gets reads from standard input

    k=16 and c=1 are recommended for small genome like bacteria or adapter removal tasks. 
    k=20 and c=2 are recommended for large genome such as plant.

   Example: 
    ./duk  Illumina.Artifacts.fa  sample.fastq
